I created the table schema and queries using class reference materials and used YouTube, ChatGPT and Xpert Learning Assistant for troubleshooting (I accidently reversed the order of two columns during the creation of the dept_emp table and spent hours researching solutions for a problem that I didn't realize I had inadvertadly caused by doing this).  I also ran the both the table schema and queries in their entirety back through Xpert Learning Assist to identify ways to improve both.
